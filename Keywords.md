- <b>assert:</b> assert describes a predicate (a true-false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer 
thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure 
results, which typically causes execution to abort. Optional;ly enable by class-loader method.
- <b>break:</b> used to terminate program execution in the current loop body.
- <b>case:</b> a statement in the switch block can be labeled by one or more case and default labels. The switch statement evaluates 
its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label.
- <b>catch:</b> Used in conjuction with a try block and an optional finally block. The statements in the catch block specify what to
do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the try block.
- <b>class:</b> A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class 
fields, methods, and inner classes as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of 
the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass is explicitly object. The class keyword can be used
in the form Class.class to get a class object without needing an instance of that class. For example, a String.class can be
used instead of doing new String().getClass().
- <b>const:</b> Although reserved as a keyword in Java, const is not used and has no function. For defining constants in Java, see 
the final reserved word.
- <b>continue:</b> Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, coninue resumes
execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.
- <b>default:</b> The default keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to be executed
if no case matches the specified
