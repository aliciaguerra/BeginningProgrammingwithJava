- <b>assert:</b> assert describes a predicate (a true-false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer 
thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure 
results, which typically causes execution to abort. Optional;ly enable by class-loader method.

- <b>break:</b> used to terminate program execution in the current loop body.

- <b>case:</b> a statement in the switch block can be labeled by one or more case and default labels. The switch statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label.

- <b>catch:</b> Used in conjuction with a try block and an optional finally block. The statements in the catch block specify what to do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the try block.

- <b>class:</b> A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class  fields, methods, and inner classes as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of  the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass is explicitly object. The class keyword can be used
in the form Class.class to get a class object without needing an instance of that class. For example, a String.class can be
used instead of doing new String().getClass().

- <b>const:</b> Although reserved as a keyword in Java, const is not used and has no function. For defining constants in Java, see the final reserved word.

- <b>continue:</b> Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, coninue resumes
execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.

- <b>default:</b> The default keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to be executed
if no case matches the specified. Alternatively, the default keyword can also be used to declare default values in Java
annotation. From Java 8 and onwards, the default keyword is also used to specify that a method in an interface provides the default implementation of the optional method.

- <b>instanceOf:</b> A binary operator that takes an object reference as its first operand and a class or interface as its second operand and produces a boolean as a result. The instanceOf operator evaluates to true if and only if the runtime type of the object is assignment compatible with the class or interface.

- <b>interface:</b> Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods, constant (static final) fields and static interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the implements keyword.

- <b>long: </b> The long keyword is used to declare a variable that can declare a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. The keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of primitive type long.
